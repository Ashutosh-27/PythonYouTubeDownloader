Pafy is a library of python which helps you to download python video but it has downside it downloads Video(without audio) if video file is selected 

( IN THAT YOUTUBE PLAYLIST ITS NOT SHOWN HOW TO FIX THIS DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR OF Pafy )


So to resolve it :-
Step 1.
    When user selects any video file to download 'downloadVideoData()'function is called which downloads that video file and also downloads a audio file by default.
    (In step2 those audio and video files id merged)

Step2.
    Initially I used moviepy library functions itself to merge two files but those functions are heavy and required a lot of processing power.
    So decided to change it . With some research came across to 'ffmpeg' a developer friendly tool to merge files and requires much less processing power.
    But its very unusual to use ffmpeg tools directly with python So i navigated little more , on this web page (https://dev-qa.com/1909133/how-do-i-use-ffmpeg-moviepy-on-hosting ) 
    it's mentioned that moviepy library also consist of ffmpeg.
    line.9 of python file ffmpeg  is imported from moviepy
